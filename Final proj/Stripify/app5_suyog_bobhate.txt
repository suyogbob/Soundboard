AVPlayer Questions:
1. AVPlayer is part of AVFoundation. AVFoundation is part of the Media layer.
2. Our media asset is an .m4a file fetched from a url. This file is the song sample from iTunes
3. AVPlayer can automatically fetch files from a given url because of its init(url: URL) constructor. This is because it supports HTTP Live Streaming of media assets. It also plays one media asset at a time, which works for us since we do not want multiple media assets playing at the same time.
